1. **Select a Language**  
   From the main menu, choose the input language you want to use.
   ![select language](../select_language)

3. **Enter a Word**  
   Start typing a word. The system will display matching icons based on your input. It is not available a full list of our icons to consult.

> [!IMPORTANT]

   - Part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, conjunction, adverb, neutral.)
   - Mood (imperative, conditional)
   - Tense (19 different verbal tenses)
   - Case (semantic roles to mark the relationship between participants: agent, patient or reciprocal)
   - Gender (Male, Female Non-Binary)
<p>Now save and close the tab and you have your modified icon. You can keep adding new icons, or downloading the sentence in PNG format.</p>

6. **Adjust Icon Order**
You can drag and rearrange icons to reflect the desired sentence structure.

## Show Translation

We added a feature that displays the translation of each icon in all supported languages. Each icon is translated with a base form (dictionary entry) and do not change according to the grammatical modification you applied to the icon. 

> [!WARNING]  
> To change the translation language, you must rebuild the sentence in the chosen language.
