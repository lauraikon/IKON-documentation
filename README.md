# Welcome to IKON Documentation

>[ !NOTE ]  
>This repository contains **sample documentation** created to demonstrate technical writing and structuring skills.  
It is based on my work as a chief linguist for the IKON visual language project by KomunIKON.  
This is a simplified and public version – some details are omitted for confidentiality. 

The repository contains documentation for the IKON language. 
It has been created for 2 reasons:

1. To guide new linguists and graphics in understanding IKON principles and rules.
2. To have a structured content that can be intagrated in our resources (website and web app) to educate external users. 

## What is IKON?

IKON is an icon-based language developed by the Swiss association KomunIKON. IKON incorporates grammar, syntax, and vocabulary to form complete sentences.
It is designed to support:
- language students and teachers
- illiterate adults
- tourists
- Anyone else facing language barriers

## Documentation Structure

This repository includes the following resources:

1. **[IKON Grammar and Language Theory](/theory/ikon-language.md)**  
   Detailed explanation of icon types, grammar rules, syntax, examples, and possible applications.  

2. **[Web App User Guide](/user-guide/webapp-guide.md)**  
   A practical guide to using the *text2ikon* web app to build sentences in IKON.
