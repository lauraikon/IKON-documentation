## Getting Started

1. **Select a Language**  
   From the main menu, choose the input language you want to use.

2. **Enter a Word**  
   Start typing a word. The system will display matching icons based on your input.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The system is able to retrieve only an exact alphabetical match (for example verb in infinite form). A more semantic processing to retrive synonyms, morphological flexion is under progress.   

4. **Choose an Icon**  
   Select the icon that best matches your intended meaning.

5. **Add Grammatical Modifiers**

   You can enrich the icon with various grammatical features:
   - Part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, conjunction, adverb, neutral.)
   - Mood (imperative, conditional)
   - Tense (19 different verbal tenses)
   - Case (semantic roles to mark the relationship between participants: agent, patient or reciprocal)
   - Gender (Male, Female Non-Binary)
<p>Now save and close the tab and you have your modified icon. You can keep adding new icons, or downloading the sentence in PNG format.</p>

## Show Translation

We added a feature that displays the translation of each icon in all supported languages.

> [!WARNING]  
> To change the translation language, you must rebuild the sentence in the chosen language. The translation don't show the grammatical modification.
