# Type of Icons

## Semantic - graphic strategies

These are the basic strategies used to translate words into icons. They are based on linguistic analysis and graphic optimization.


| TYPE OF ICON          | DESCRIPTION |
|----------------------|------------|
| PICTOGRAPHIC          | A prototypical and conventional type of an item. Example: the most telling representation of a window. |
| SYMBOLIC              | Use of symbols already used in the iconography of a specific domain (mathematics, road signs, genders, etc.). |
| HYPERONYMIC (Supertype)| A meaning whose representation includes a group of other related words (hyponyms or subtypes). Examples: *wood* + *glass* + *paper* → *material*; a set of different species → *animal*. |
| HYPONYMIC (Subtype)  | Highlight a specific member of the hyperonymic set. |
| CONTRASTIVE           | One meaning opposite to another. The intended meaning is marked with green thick, on the right (or on top according to the icon orientation). |
| PROCESSUAL            | Representation of an event’s phases or stages, which together form the event's temporal structure. Use 1 and 2 (or even 3 if necessary). Examples: *to take*, *to choose*. |
| TRANSFORMATIVE        | Icons showing a process that leads to a change of state. Examples: *to get tired* *is rested* + transformative arrow + *tired* |
| CORRELATIVE           |Two icons are combined to form a compound word. Examples: **what*+*thing* → **what|


## PRONOUNS

Personal pronouns are represented with people. The set includes traditional pronouns along with inclusive "we" (me, you and possibly someone else) and exclusive "we" (me, someone else but not you). The pronouns use the gray border.

## PREPOSITIONS

Prepositions are mostly expressed with an orange ball in a spatial relation to other elements.
The set includes static prepositions (*in*) and dynamic ones (*into*).

> Other elements can become prepositions according to the meaning they assume in the sentence. Example: *of* + noun in expressions of quantity is expressed by the icon for *amount/quantity* in a prepositional border.

## BORDERS
IKON associates colours and shapes to parts of speech and each icon must be contained in a coloured border:

- Yellow for nounsred for verbs.
- Blue for adjectives.
- Orange for adverbs
- Green for conjunctions and prepositions.
- Gray for pronouns or other indefinite elements.
- The plural is marked through an overlapping of three borders.

This allows an easier comprehension of the structure of the language and the role of each icon in the sentence.
