# IKON Overview

The ever-expanding IKON Set has been developed over the past 10 years, reaching 1000 icons. This growth is not random: the lexicon of IKON is built starting from a core set of around 500 icons covering basic concepts in most languages to more complex, but still frequent words.  
IKON is highly rooted in Esperanto vocabulary and structure. New icons are also created for side projects.

## Type of Icons

### Semantic – Graphic Strategies

These are the basic strategies used to translate words into icons, based on linguistic analysis and graphic optimization.

| Type of Icon | Description |
|--------------|------------|
| PICTOGRAPHIC | A prototypical and conventional type of an item. Example: the most telling representation of a window. |
| SYMBOLIC | Use of symbols already used in the iconography of a specific domain (mathematics, road signs, genders, etc.). |
| HYPERONYMIC (Supertype) | Icons containing three to four elements to show examples of a larger category. Examples: *wood + glass + paper → material*; a set of different species → *animal*. |
| HYPONYMIC (Subtype) | Highlights a specific member of the hyperonymic set. |
| CONTRASTIVE | Meaning emerges from comparing two concepts (often opposites). The intended meaning is marked with green thick line on the right (or top) according to icon orientation. |
| PROCESSUAL | Represents an event’s phases or stages. Examples: *to take*, *to choose*. |
| TRANSFORMATIVE | Shows a process leading to a change of state. Examples: *to get tired*: *is rested* + transformative arrow + *tired*. |
| CORRELATIVE | Two icons combined to form a compound word. Example: *what + thing → what* |

## Arrows, Lines, Circles

| Symbol | Description |
|--------|------------|
| INDICATIVE ARROWS | Solid purple arrow indicating a specific object inside scenes with multiple objects. |
| INDICATIVE CIRCLES | Dashed purple circle indicating part of an object or group of elements. |
| TRANSFORMATIVE ARROWS | Solid purple arrow showing change of state from one state to another. |
| MOTION ARROWS AND LINES | Dashed purple arrows and lines help interpret motion and distinguish directions. |

## People, Family, and Pronouns

### People and Jobs

- Genderless and non-cultural human figures are gray (full, half body, or only hands).  
- Profession is indicated by adding a qualifying element to the gray person.  
- Personal pronouns are represented with people. Includes traditional pronouns plus inclusive “we” (me + you + possibly someone else) and exclusive “we” (me + someone else but not you). Pronouns use gray borders.

### Family

- Family members are gender-specific or neutral, coded via hairstyle, symbols, and color (blue/pink).  
- The referenced member is colored; an indicative arrow shows the perspective. Example: from mother to son → *mother*; from son to mother → *son*.

## Prepositions

Prepositions are mostly expressed with an orange ball in spatial relation to other elements (static: *in*; dynamic: *into*).

> [!TIP]  
> Other elements can act as prepositions depending on context.  
> Example: *of* + noun in quantity expressions → *amount/quantity* icon in prepositional border.  
> Example: *to give* in a prepositional border → dative *to*.

## Grammar

### Borders

IKON assigns colors and shapes to parts of speech. Each icon is contained in a colored border:  

- Yellow → Nouns  
- Red → Verbs  
- Blue → Adjectives  
- Orange → Adverbs  
- Green → Conjunctions & prepositions  
- Gray → Pronouns / indefinite elements  
- Plural → Overlapping three borders  

> [!TIP]  
> **Why are borders useful?**  
> Imagine sentences without borders — the meaning would be lost.

### Tenses

- IKON expresses verbal tenses using *timelines*.  
- A timeline appears beneath each icon: a central notch marks time 0 (present).  
- A purple dot or segment shows past, present, or future.  
- Another vertical bar can indicate the reference time for complex tenses (e.g., present perfect).  
- Timeline also shows verbal aspect: punctual, continuous, or repeated.

> [!NOTE]  
> A full list of tense icons for English is forthcoming. They are designed to match other languages’ tenses.

### Negation

IKON uses a single negation form before the word:  

- *she no-NEG have-VERB interest in something* (completely lacks possession of interest)  
- *she no-NEG interested-ADJ in something* (focus on state)  
- *she no-NEG (is-VERB) happy-ADJ*  
- *No-NEG go-VERB* (do not go)

## Time

### Time-related Words

Includes: day, night, morning, afternoon, evening, today, tomorrow, yesterday, week, weekend, month, year, seasons, hours, minutes, seconds.

### Adverbs of Time

- Represented with timeline + clock classifier  
- Describe when or how often an action happens

---

## Quantifiers

- *All, some, none* expressed through contrastive icons (sets of circles with points; intended meaning is circled).

---

## Advanced Grammar

### Iconemes

Iconemes are modifiers with grammatical functions:  

- Gender markers: male/female symbols  
- Imperative: exclamation point  
- Conditional: yes/no/question mark  
- Time tenses: see timeline section  
- Diathesis: agent-action (square), patient-action (circle)  
- Reflexive / reciprocal  
- Reference  

> [!NOTE]  
> Borders are also iconemes (assign lexical category).

### Word Order
The visual nature of IKON makes it possible to use flexible syntactic approaches.
- Flexible: right-to-left, left-to-right, top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top  
- Can follow semantic schema: verb connected to arguments

It is up to writers to adjust this order according to what they are accustomed to in their native language, to what they deem most important, or to what burdens readers the least. However, it is important to consider that the most relevant word orders are subject-object-verb (SOV) and subject-verb-object (SVO), the former being the most common.
 

### Semantic Predication – Mathematical Symbols

- Preposition “of” / verb “belong”: use ∈  
- Verb “to be” (equivalence): use =  
- Simplified: everyday users can use = even if concepts aren’t fully equivalent

> [!TIP]  
> Example: *Paris = fascinating* is sufficient for most cases.

## Applications

### Language Learning

- Supports sentence construction, especially for learners with communicative challenges  
- Icons represent subjects, verbs, tense, objects, complements  
- Teachers can display icons in semantic graphic schema starting from verb as core, with arguments branching out

### Icons for Digital Platforms

- Promotes inclusive, comprehensible visual communication  
- Avoids abstract or meaningless icons

### Games

- Integrated into roleplay games to provide narrative input  
- Concrete and stimulating scenes cover wide vocabulary range
