## Type of Icons

| TYPE OF ICON          | DESCRIPTION |
|----------------------|------------|
| PICTOGRAPHIC          | A prototypical and conventional type of an item. Example: the most telling representation of a window. |
| SYMBOLIC              | Use of symbols already used in the iconography of a specific domain (mathematics, road signs, genders, etc.). |
| HYPERONYMIC (Supertype)| A meaning whose representation includes a group of other related words (hyponyms or subtypes). Examples: *wood* + *glass* + *paper* → *material*; a set of different species → *animal*. |
| HYPONYMIC (Subtype)  | Highlight a specific member of the hyperonymic set. |
| CONTRASTIVE           | One meaning opposite to another. The intended meaning is marked with green thick, on the right (or on top according to the icon orientation). |
| PROCESSUAL            | Representation of an event’s phases or stages, which together form the event's temporal structure. Use 1 and 2 (or even 3 if necessary). Examples: *to take*, *to choose*. |
| TRANSFORMATIVE        | Icons showing a process that leads to a change of state. Examples: *to get tired* *is rested* + transformative arrow + *tired* |
| CORRELATIVE           |Two icons are combined to form a compound word. Examples: **what*+*thing*->**what|
